### **Core Objectives**

1. **Emerging patterns and practice recognition**
    - Identify emerging patterns in context handling across the industry
    - Document best practices as they develop in real-world implementations
    - Provide guidance on key technologies and methodologies
2. **Standards development and adoption**
    - Transform proven patterns into formal, actionable standards.
        - There’s no rush to standardize, but where clear, important patterns have emerged they should have clear practices documented and ratified as a versioned standard.
    - Facilitate community review
    - Ensure standards are practical and implementable across diverse systems
3. **Ecosystem interoperability**
    - Enable seamless integration between different tools, agents, and models
    - Reduce friction for developers working across multiple platforms to support advanced context capabilities

### **Expected Outcomes**

- **Reduced implementation complexity** - Developers spend less time on context handling infrastructure
- **Improved interoperability** - Systems work together more seamlessly
- **Enhanced developer experience** - Predictable, well-documented context handling patterns
- **Accelerated innovation** - Standardized foundation enables focus on higher-level capabilities
- **Community collaboration** - Central forum for discussing and advancing context-related technologies

### **Key Focus Areas**

#### **Context Selection and Scoping**

- Local context selection algorithms and best practices
- Methods for determining relevant context boundaries
- Strategies for context prioritization and filtering

#### **Versioning and Evolution**

- Context schemes and backward compatibility
- Update mechanisms for evolving context requirements
- Migration paths between context format versions

#### **Format Standardization**

- Standard file formats for context storage and transmission
- Metadata schemas for context description and classification
- Encoding standards for various data types within context

#### **Adaptive Context Delivery**

- Dynamic context adaptation based on downstream system capabilities
- Context compression, resolution, and optimization techniques
- Performance considerations for context-heavy applications


## **Transparency**

The group will conduct all technical work publicly in GitHub repositories rather than private communications, ensuring that contributions can be properly tracked through software tools. While meetings may be restricted to Community Group participants, the group must maintain transparency by posting any material conversations/outcomes to the initiative's GitHub Discussions for broader community visibility.


## Decision Making

This group operates with an odd number of official participants to ensure clear resolution when voting becomes necessary. The group seeks consensus-based decisions, with participants free to determine their own decision-making process.

When substantial disagreement persists and progress requires resolution (which should be exceedingly rare), all participants must vote to determine the path forward. No abstentions are permitted - every member must weigh in to settle disputed issues. Participants who disagree with the final decision are encouraged to pursue alternative approaches through forking, which is preferred over blocking group progress.

All decisions, are recorded in GitHub Discussions and remain tentative for 7 days. Any participant may object within this period by providing clear technical reasoning.

## Steering Committee

The Steering Committee is responsible for the overall direction and governance of the initiative. It is responsible for:

- Ensuring alignment with the mission and objectives of the initiative
- Making key decisions and setting direction for the initiative
- Ensuring the initiative's activities align with the community's goals and values

Steering Committee members are selected by committee members using the decision process outlined in the [Decision Making](#decision-making) section. Generally speaking, committee members are selected through evidence of commitment to the mission and objectives of the initiative and/or technical influence to the related industry verticals.


## Chair

The Chairs must maintain fair decision-making processes that honor community consensus while avoiding bias toward any participant or organization.

Participants select their Chair(s) and may replace them at any time through their preferred method. However, when >75% of participants from different organizations request an election, the group must follow this process, coordinating with the Community Development Lead:

**Candidate Announcement Phase**: Participants have 7 days to declare candidacy, ending early once all have stated their intentions. A single candidate automatically becomes Chair. Two or more candidates trigger a vote. No candidates means no change.

**Voting Phase**: Participants have 7 days to vote for one candidate, ending early when all votes are cast. The candidate receiving the most votes from different organizations wins. If there is a tie, https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2777 will be used to determine the winner. The elected Chair may appoint co-Chairs.
