## **Community Process**

### **1. Proposal specs**

Sharing ideas/plans for context handling and delivery practices.

- **Community-driven specs/proposals** - Contributors propose specifications (via GitHub issues/discussions) based on emerging patterns and real-world needs
- **Use case documentation** - Clear articulation of problems being solved and target scenarios
- **Initial feedback** - Community review and discussion of proposed approaches

### **2. Development phase**

- **Interest assessment** - Gauge community and implementer support for proposed standards
- **Collaborative refinement** - Iterative improvement based on community input
- **Prototype implementation** - Reference implementations to validate feasibility

### **3. Adoption Phase**

Validate the practices in production environments and gather feedback from implementers.

- **Real-world testing** - Standards tested in production environments
- **Implementation feedback** - Continuous improvement based on adopter experiences
- **Ecosystem integration** - Support for widespread adoption across tools and platforms

### **4. Standardization Phase**

When practices have been validated in production and have received community and implementer support, they can be ratified as a versioned standard.

- **Formal specification** - Finalized standards with clear compliance criteria
- **Certification framework** - Methods for verifying standard compliance
- **Long-term maintenance** - Ongoing support and evolution of established standards
