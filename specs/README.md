# OCS specs

The Open Context Standards (OCS) initiative is a community-driven initiative that establishes and maintains open standards for how context for AI systems is structured, parsed, delivered, and verified across all computing platforms and AI systems.

## **Specs**

This directory will be home to the specs for the OCS initiative. Given this is a brand-new initiative, expect to find proposals and drafts within Github discussions, issues, and pull requests.
